**Introduction:**
This project is a simple User Management System developed using Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data stored in a MySQL database. The system is built to handle basic user information like username, email, and password.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to create a basic web application for managing user data using popular technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. It serves as a practical example for developers who want to understand how to build CRUD functionality and interact with a database within a web application.

**Features:**
- **Create User:** Users can add new users by providing a username, email, and password.
- **Read User:** Users can view a list of all existing users along with their details.
- **Update User:** Users can update the username of an existing user by providing the user's ID and the new username. Password authentication is required for security.
- **Delete User:** Users can delete an existing user by providing the user's ID. Password authentication is required for security.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.
- **Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js used to build the server-side application.
- **MySQL:** Relational database management system used for storing user data.
- **Faker.js:** Library used for generating fake data during development.
- **UUID:** Library used for generating unique identifiers.
